- **Description:** <br/>	
This dataset supports the study titled "Comparative evaluation of nutritional composition, chemical constituents, and bioactive potential of wild versus ex-situ cultivated _Trametes versicolor_", which investigates the feasibility and quality of cultivating T. versicolor on lignocellulosic forest residues under controlled conditions. The dataset contains the full biochemical, growth, and environmental monitoring data used for analysis and publication. _T. versicolor_ was cultivated ex situ on logs under controlled environmental conditions. The resulting fruiting bodies were compared with wild samples collected from Montesinho Natural Park (MNP), Portugal. The focus was on nutritional composition, phenolic profile, antioxidant capacity, and antimicrobial potential.
